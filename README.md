# Portfolio

## Description

This is a small portfolio page that will be used to showcase the projects I have worked on.

- Page has information on my background, skills, recent projects, and ways to contact me.
- First independent time using FlexBox to create a responsive CSS layout.
- Utilized FontAwesome to integrate svg icons for Email and LinkedIn.
- Had to create a layout that flowed well in addition to showcasing myself.
- Wanted to make sure a "showcase" type project stood out from the others by making it larger.
